## For Graders - Getting Started
- Unzip the files into a directory on your testing environment.
- Ensure that your `act.txt` file is located within the same directory as the python files. Refer to the structure of the zip archive itself for reference.
- This readme assumes you're testing on the flip server which has python built into it (v2.7.5)

### Testing lastToStart.py
1) To test the lastToStart.py program simply run the following command `python lastToStart.py`.

2) The results will be written to the terminal and should look like this:
